Another simple Data processor (has "in development" status, only base tools work).

This processor enables you to create data processing pipelines in YAML format and executes the specified ETL pipelines
when the application is launched. With this processor, you can connect to any popular database(now only PostgreSQL) or 
data file, flexibly configure their processing, and load them into the target data system.
